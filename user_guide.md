## üìã Complete Command Reference

### üîß Wallet Management Commands

#### `/start`
- **Purpose**: Creates your main wallet and initializes the bot

### üîÑ Mixing Commands

#### `/mixto [count]`
- **Purpose**: Start the mixing process to create multiple sub-wallets
- **Usage**: `/mixto 10` (creates 10 mixed wallets)
- **Range**: 2-100 wallets
- **Requirements**: 
  - Minimum 500,000 PILL tokens
  - Sufficient SOL for fees (see breakdown below)
- **SOL Requirements** (operational funding, not lost fees):
  - **Layer 1 Funding**: 0.06-0.09 SOL per wallet (gets transferred forward)
  - **Transaction Fees**: ~0.01 SOL per transaction (actual network fees)
  - **Buffer**: 0.1 SOL safety buffer
  - **Important**: Most SOL is transferred to your final wallets, not lost as fees
  - **Example**: 5 wallets ‚âà 0.55 SOL, 10 wallets ‚âà 1.0 SOL, 20 wallets ‚âà 1.4 SOL
- **Process**: Creates a new batch and mixes your PILL through 3 layers
- **Example**: `/mixto 5` creates 5 mixed wallets in batch #1

#### `/getmixcount`
- **Purpose**: Shows how many mixing batches you've created
- **Usage**: `/getmixcount`
- **Shows**: Total number of completed mixes

#### `/getmixkeys [batch_number]`
- **Purpose**: Get private keys for a specific batch
- **Usage**: `/getmixkeys 1` (gets keys for batch #1)

### üéØ External Distribution Commands

#### `/regpub [batch_number] [address1] [address2] ...`
- **Purpose**: Register external wallet addresses where you want to receive your mixed funds
- **Usage**: `/regpub 1 ABC123... DEF456... GHI789...`
- **Limits**: 
  - Up to 10 addresses per command
  - Must register exactly as many addresses as wallets in the batch
- **Validation**: 
  - Checks if addresses are valid Solana addresses
  - Prevents duplicate addresses (across all users)
  - Prevents adding the same address twice
- **Example**: If you created 5 wallets with `/mixto 5`, you need to register exactly 5 external addresses

#### `/sendpub [batch_number]`

## üìñ Step-by-Step Tutorial

### Scenario: Splitting 1,000,000 PILL into 10 separate wallets

#### Step 1: Initialize Your Wallet
```
Send: /start
Bot Response: Shows your main wallet address
```

#### Step 2: Fund Your Main Wallet
- Send **1 SOL** (for transaction fees) to your main wallet address
- Send **1,000,000 PILL** tokens to your main wallet address
- Verify with `/balance`

#### Step 3: Create Mixed Wallets
```
Send: /mixto 10
Bot Response: Creates batch #1 with 10 mixed sub-wallets
Process: Your PILL is mixed through 3 layers and distributed to 10 wallets
```

#### Step 4: Backup Your Keys
```
Send: /getmixkeys 1
Bot Response: Shows 10 wallet addresses and their private keys
Action: Save these keys securely (write them down or store safely)
```

#### Step 5: Prepare External Wallets
- Create 10 new wallets in Phantom (or your preferred wallet)
- Copy the 10 public addresses

#### Step 6: Register External Addresses
```
Send: /regpub 1 [paste your 10 Phantom addresses here]
Bot Response: Confirms how many addresses were added successfully
```

#### Step 7: Transfer to External Wallets
```
Send: /sendpub 1
Bot Response: Transfers all PILL and SOL to your 10 Phantom wallets
Result: Each Phantom wallet receives approximately 100,000 PILL + remaining SOL
```

#### Step 8: Verify Completion
```
Send: /getmixcount
Bot Response: Shows you have completed 1 batch

# You can also try the regpub command to see if the batch is complete:
Send: /regpub 1
Bot Response: If complete, will show "Cannot reset batch #1 - transfers have already been completed"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Safety Guidelines

### üîê Security Best Practices
- **Never share your private keys** with anyone
- **Always backup your keys** before using `/mixdelkeys`
- **Double-check external addresses** before registering them
- **Use the bot only in private messages** (it won't work in groups)

### üí∞ Financial Considerations
- **Minimum PILL**: You need at least 500,000 PILL tokens to start mixing
- **SOL requirements**: Budget approximately 0.09 SOL per wallet + small transaction fees (most gets transferred to your final wallets)
- **Complete transfer**: All funds will be moved to external wallets - nothing stays in sub-wallets

### üö´ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't register more addresses than you have sub-wallets
- Don't use the same external address twice
- Don't forget to backup your keys before deleting them
- Don't try to use commands on completed batches

## üîç Understanding Batch Status

### Batch Lifecycle
1. **Created**: Batch exists with sub-wallets, but no external addresses registered
2. **Partially Registered**: Some external addresses registered, but not all
3. **Fully Registered**: All external addresses registered, ready for transfer
4. **Complete**: All transfers completed, no further operations possible

### How to Check Your Batch Progress

Since `/status` is now admin-only, here's how to check your progress:

1. **Check total batches**: Use `/getmixcount` to see how many batches you've created
2. **Verify batch exists**: Use `/getmixkeys [batch_number]` to confirm a batch exists
3. **Check registration status**: Try `/regpub [batch_number]` without addresses to see current status
4. **Check transfer status**: Try `/sendpub [batch_number]` to see if transfers are needed or complete

### Example Progress Check
```
# Check how many batches you have
Send: /getmixcount
Response: You have completed 2 mixes

# Check if batch 1 is complete
Send: /sendpub 1
Response: "Batch #1 is already completed" (if done) or transfer process starts (if ready)

# Check if you need to register more addresses for batch 2
Send: /regpub 2
Response: "You need to register 2 more addresses before sending" (if incomplete)
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Batch does not exist"
- Check your batch numbers with `/getmixcount`
- Make sure you've completed the mixing process with `/mixto`
- Try using `/getmixkeys [batch_number]` to verify the batch exists

### "Invalid wallet address format"
- Ensure you're using valid Solana wallet addresses
- Check for typos in the address

### "Already added by another user"
- Someone else has already registered this address
- Use a different external wallet address

### "You need to register X more addresses"
- You haven't registered enough external addresses
- Use `/regpub [batch] [more addresses...]` to add the remaining ones

### "Insufficient SOL for fees"
- Add more SOL to your main wallet
- You need approximately 0.09 SOL per wallet + small transaction fees (most gets transferred forward)

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check this user guide first
2. Use `/getmixcount` to see how many batches you have
3. Use `/getmixkeys [batch_number]` to verify your batches exist
4. Ensure you're following the correct sequence of commands
5. Verify you have sufficient funds (SOL and PILL)

## üéØ Pro Tips

- **Start small**: Try with 2-3 wallets first to understand the process
- **Organize your external wallets**: Label them clearly in your wallet app
- **Keep records**: Note down which batch corresponds to which external wallets
- **Plan your fees**: Always have extra SOL for unexpected transaction costs
- **Check your progress regularly**: Use `/getmixcount` and try the next step commands to understand where you are in the process
